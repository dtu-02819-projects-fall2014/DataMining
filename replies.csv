That dog must have felt like much more of a winner than the other dogs.
"Even as she runs up he is still going, ""Just one more bite.... Maybe two... Ok yea I'm good."""
"He trained for months for this.  Not for the performance, but because he knew there would be treats.  And it was glorious."
"""if this is losing I don't want to be a winner"" "
"You can really see his thought process.

""Okay, get ready, don't fuck this up, she'll tell you to go and you'll go...come on, you trained for this..ALRIGHT GO..""

""..OH BALL, OH FOOD, TOY, FOOD, THIS IS A MAGICAL ROAD OF GOODIES"""
That's how I feel studying in the same room as my ps4 and netflix. 
Is that Vladmir Putin as the ref?
May be my favorite dog post ever. I was dearly hoping he'd stop to pee on something.
"'yea see, she is petting me, ima good boy!"""
yeah a golden retriever is a tough breed of dog to train for this race.
"Ask yourselves this, who really won that race?"
"Retrieve all the things!
"
"He got to the end, and he was looking back at the course like: ""Did I get everything??"""
"""DOESNT MATTER : HAD TREATS"""
"Oh man, when his trainer comes over, haha. ""OH, A TINY SINGLE TREAT IN YOUR HAND? THAT'S CUTE. DO YOU SEE THESE PLATES BRIMMING WITH MEATS AND TREATS?!?!?! BE WITH YOU SHORTLY."""
"The part in Finnish really makes this video:

Girl at 00:40: Here, come come come! Good!

Presenter: Esme (first dog) goes through the highway of temptations wonderfully, doesn't doubt for a se- *Benny Hill music*"
"this is like us..

some people are praised for having discipline, working hard, and being patient for rewards. other people just enjoy the moment and get what they can out of the situation.

one demonstrates the capacity of its potential.

the other demonstrates having a blast when he can.

idk..im pretty high right now"
[Better than this one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmuWFcbQUU)
"Would've prefered it without the Benny Hill music slapped on top. I wanted to hear the girl's panicked ""No! Come here! Look, NO"""
"Putin referees dog races, he can't be *that* evil. "
"""Do what you must, I've already won."""
Lesson to be learned? Don't put your dog into this type of race on an empty stomach.
I like how they clap for the fact that the dog ate everything in its path and ignored its owner
"I've heard people sometimes refer to these as ""Golden Retards"" due to their spastic nature."
"Is this Finnish? Hyv√§ is ""good"" I think"
Lady steals random golden retriever to enter obedience contest
It's cool they got Woody Harrelson and putin's love child to ref. 
And it was the best day ever.
"What an adorably stupid animal! The German Shepherd went straight through, but this dog just went ""OMG, BALL! FOOD! MOAR FOOD!""

I'd pet him at the end too. I'd be shaking my head, but I would pet him and give him a hug.

""That'll do, pig... That'll do..."""

EAT ALL THE THINGS!!
is this the same dog that faked his death to sell Bush's Baked Beans recipe?
"That look at the end. ""Ya, I did everything right. I wouldn't have done it any other way. GO ME!"""
How is she so surprised ? She MUST have know this would happen.
First thing he goes for is the ball.
"I wanna know what event happened that made this girl think her dog was ready for competition, outside of perhaps an eating contest.
"
That's so funny. It kind of reflects how weird it is that disregarding everything that's good in life for a meaningless prize is what constitutes intelligence for us. Repress those impulses and achieve civility!
This makes me want to take my stupid ass golden to compete in a dog show.
Really could've done without Yakkety Saks. 
"Belgian Malinois, beautiful dogs.  Goldens are great also."
He is just making sure that his buddy (next in line for the run) is not distracted by all the food and can pull of the world record time.
PLEASE TAKE A SHIT. PLEASE TAKE A SHIT. PLEASE TAKE A SHIT. Damn...
"""Okay here I come!  Oh, when did they open the snack bar?"""
"As a guy who has had basset hands his entire life, this would be simply impossible because there would be 3 naps before the end of the carpet. 



Edit: hounds.  Not hands.  "
everything is better with yakkity sax
Look how happy he is. He can't figure out which of these awesome treats to finish up with first.
"Me, if I was a dog."
"The dog from ""Up"" in real life. SQUIRREL!!"
"That dog is not made to win prices, it's made for lovin"
"Q: So how do you see your performance today, Whoppie Goldie?

A: ""I got all the things and ate all the treats as fast as I could, I'm sure I had enough time to get the last two and get an even higher score if the bitch didn't decide to stand in my way and pulled me out.""

- Wetnose Sports Magazine"
If ONLY he took a shit at the end then this video would be complete.
Is that Vladimir Putin as the referee? 
My favorite part is after the girl has him by the collar he still turns and picks up his umpteenth treat on his way out. 
I like how at the end the dog is still looking back at all the stuff that's still there to eat/play with
"Funny video, but may I just take this opportunity say to Berta Lovejoy and all the other reddit novelty youtube accounts that now take top place on all youtubes videos linked here;

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the puss filled, toxic, scum pond that was the youtube comment section and adding radioactive waste, discarded heroin needles and poisonous frogs.
"
I think its safe to say that this dog did not pass.

"""Nah son, free pie."" .jpg"
I really love this video. I just found out that my girlfriend cheated on me just 4 hours ago and i actually laughed out loud watching this. I know you guys really dont care but this video really cheered me up. thanks. 
He's a fuckin dog. Good on him for not putting up with those assholes' bullshit.
I want to hang out with that dog.
he didn't poop. He's well trained.
Wtf was that a whole sausage? Looked like a whole log of liverwurst.
I wanna play with all the toys and eat all the food
"It would have even been better if he shat at the end of the course.
"
It looks like the owner brought her to be fed. Free food!! 
that's the best time a golden has ever got.
"oh dam it, was hoping he would do a massive dump at the end of it all."
"This is why I'm sceptical about using learnability among dogs as a sign of intelligence. The dog that gets the most treats must be the smartest, right?"
Berta Lovejoy
I laughed my ass off watching this.
"""Yeah yeah, I'm comin'. Just after this..."""
"I imagine this dog in Louis C.K's voice yelling at the dog before him ""You idiot the food is right there! what are you doing!? get the food! you'll die you idiot!"""
"oMG this made my day, thanks OP! "
The only thing that could have made that better would be if he popped a squat at the finish line.
I do good? 
Golden has it right.
"I love how she ends up not giving a shit about the fact she's being watched by thousands, and just kicks the dog at 1:34"
"Clever dog.
"
"""Fuck you , I'm hungry """
I was hoping he'd take a dump at the end
"I was waiting for obligatory ""let me just take a dump onto that carpet"""
this dog is my spirit animal
i was hoping he'd take a dump at the end
"This is one smart dog. I love the ref's look. He's so serious checking the time. That piss pour girl kneeing the dog to get across the line and then dragging him. Sad. He's already lost, let him enjoy his last place award."
"Just imagine how happy this dog must've been. A carpet filled with awesome things for it to play with/eat.

Kid in a candy store! (or alternatively, puppy in a sausage factory!)"
[so the dog version of this guy](http://media.ifunny.com/results/2013/03/22/rf2hy13uzl.jpg)
Well... http://youtu.be/oo7Q8A60yTM?t=31s
The referee looks like Putin 
"Used to have a parson russel terrier  who, once let out to do his business, would make a beeline for the barn to quickly grab a mouth full of horse shit. Didnt stop if you yelled at him. Then he'd go do his business. This happened EVERY DAMN TIME he was let out.

You would have to chase him down and pry his jaws apart and physically remove the horse shit from them. 

It got so bad that we had to leash him to take him to do his business. He would still make a dash for the barn and then get yanked by the leash when he reached the end. 

Fuckin manic breeds. "
Greatest. Dog. EVER!!!
I'M NOT A PART OF YOUR SYSTEM!
"""Did I get them all, master? Do well, master? Time to dump, master!"""
That ref looks like a cross between Lucius Vorenus and Vladamir Putin.
"That's my secret, taking the food was my trick."
"Reminds me of Fenton https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GRSbr0EYYU
"
As a former Golden Retriever owner this looks normal to me.
FUCK YOUR STUPID GAMES BITCH!
Why is Vladimir Putin using a stopwatch in this video?
How'd you find my dog and take him on a show when I wasn't looking?
"He must have thought that was the competition. So much like me.

When I was a kid, I took part in this silly competition where you had to create the longest chain of straws to win. The host told us we had to 'insert the end of one straw by squeezing it into another, like so' to make a chain. 

I made twenty five two-straw pairs and sat there really pleased with myself. So fucking confident I didn't even glance at the other contestants who were stringing them *all* together."
That's my peaches all right. At the end it's looking back thinking there's a lot of stuff left back there man.
This is how you dog.
is that vladimir putin judging the contest
"Dem thighs on dat judge at the finish line...
"
Everything is better with Yakkity Sax
"Haha, he's like ""Wow, all that training really paid off!"""
You had one job
The YouTube comments are a sea of Redditors lol
Don't clap!
"After the show Becky walks dejectedly to her car, her shoulders drooped and her face sunken. Golden Retriever walks up to her and whispers into her ear:

""That's what happens when you trick me into going to the vet, bitch."""
That's fuckin' hilarious.
"So far this dog's priorities:

1) Ball
2) Dog Food
3) Stuffed Animal

Judging from this bit of information the dog is determined to have a pleasure centered personality.  We have much in common."
"A friend used to have a 110 pounds Golden Retriever his name was 'Gabe'. That dog would eat any food in sight. No questions asked. He was beyond gentle, he was literraly a puppy stuck in a 110 pound giant. He had an awesome life and I still miss him.

Here's to you, Gabe!"
Lexi and Lucy 
I lost it completely at the applauses.
"BUT MOM, THE SAUSAGE!! 
I enjoy personifying pets. "
Real winner!
Have a Golden Retriever; can confirm. She will do absolutely anything and everything to get a bit of food. Lovable as hell though.
I've never met a golden retreiver that wasn't starving to death.
"relevant
http://youtu.be/XNj_UPvJsig"
Did they not feed him or what? 
"It started with the first bite, then survival mode kicked. Must eat everything... Toy! Must eat everything..."
"It's a Golden RETRIEVER, what did they expect it to do? Arrive empty-handed?"
"Oh a buffet if only i could Pay for it.

Uh. it's part of the track.

Victory is mine! "
Loved its 'Will you be pissed if I go back for the remaining bowls now' look at the end. 
Vladimir Putin looks *great* in that striped shirt!
"That was a delicious race!

-Dog"
"When Putin isn't busy having commercial planes shot out of the sky, he's timing children's dog obedience races. Good to know..."
It is hard to do well when... Vladimir Putin is watching your every move with a stop watch in hand.
"I like how her nudging his head away from the food was taken as a direction towards the other food bowl... ""Oh wow, I hadn't noticed this one!"""
"i found my self saying ""please take a shit, please take a shit"" when he crossed the finish line"
I waited for him to poop at the end there. Kinda dissapoint :c
"You know how you have that friend who seems really confident of themselves, but you know they're really inept? I'm gonna gander a guess and say that dog's trainer is one of those people.   
   
""I'm gonna enter Fido into that training competition. I'm great at training dogs. Watch, sit Fido. Sit. Sit. Si-Goodboy.""   
   
""Do you think that's a good idea?""   
   
""Of course it is.""   
   
Then OP's video happens."
"don't care, had sausage."
i was waiting for the dump
Who is this Berta Lovejoy?! I wanna throw a sausage at her. 
"Referee Vladamir Putin says Smart Russian Retriever who eats sausages wins.  All other western dogs are stupid, and trying to invade mother Russia.  "
In the end he looks like he is not done yet.
"Id like to imagine that he really tried his best, but snapped under all the pressure. "
"It's a golden, what did she expect?"
"What kills me is when it picks up the ball and the toy. The food, I get it, that's a lot of food and it's probably stuff the dog doesn't normally get to eat, but the picking up the toys for half a second?"
"[Well , A Dog's Gotta Do What a Dog's Gotta Do](http://youtu.be/t_Y7xEwm6n4?t=37s)"
so what's actually supposed to happen here?
Can't forget about this one :D jnyx the wonder dog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQwpGL473SA
man i feel like dogs are natures' food vacuums
"At first, I thought the girl was joining the dog."
"He was planning on running straight through, then they played Yakety Sax over the PA and he knew he had to give them a show."
"it would not surprise me in the least if they had one dog per show that wasn't trained at all, just to make the whole event less boring."
that is a good one. upvote for you.
"Race? Naw, man... free food."

Is putin the referee? 
Is it me or is Vladimir Putin reffing this thing?
Finland mentioned! See you at the square!
His owner looks annoyed as hell. I really hope she doesn't punish him or anything.

Okay, good. It's not just me."
"I can watch videos of overweight people all day and not think much of it, but seeing this makes me want to go on a diet.  I am this dog."

Lol amazing.
The only thing missing was to then go smell the ass of all his competitors.

The most successful use of a cat I have seen yet.

Is that Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon??? hahaha sounds just like him. 
I'm Canadian and I find this crazy.
I can't even get out of a hot shower in a heated apartment without shivering. 
This is how Canadians are born.

Still, could never be one of those people that dive into the ice water.  Brrr."
Living my whole life in Vegas has wearing a sweater in 80 degree (fahrenheit ) weather. 
It's 60¬∞F in my condo right now and I'm freezing my ass off. 
cool video
Looks like Canadians and Norwegians are related.
Meanwhile its 58¬∞F (14.4¬∞C) in Florida and im pretty sure half my class has hypothermia. 
"Fuck me, when people said Canadian's sound Irish I thought it was a joke. My Uncle is Canadian and he sounds like a yank, but these guys could pass for potato munchers feasibly. "

The things people do for videos
...Hiccup?
"we used to do this as kids, keep a bubble machine off the dock in winter (moving water doesnt freeze) and jump in. its not that intense, kind of a common occurance for northern canadians."
[Reminds me of a similar one from Norway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkXy83WlLY4)
You can see them go from white in the water. To beet red when they come out.
My nipples shrunk.
This acting reminds of that start of a porno... 
"Look, the water is still liquid. It's not that cold."
you can see how much pain they are in. they are trying so hard to repress it.

Lucky it didn't end up like the scene from the omen 
and Bear Grylls tries to make it look so difficult. pffff...
"Do you have to mark the holes that you dig out for fishing, so people dont drive or fall into them? "
"There's something terrifying about the thought of being under ice like that. 

Dipping in where it's all open, with no current? Sure. It would suck but it's doable.

Makes me smile to be Canadian with a Newfoundland father....love the seasons!
"Holy shit.. how is this physically possible?

I put my hand in an ice bucket and I cant stand more than 5 seconds of the pain.

Can anyone just do this or do you need to like practice a long time for this?"
Those can't be Canadians. There wasn't a single fart joke in the entire video. 
that scared the hell out of me when the first dude started swimming up
"I would be dead, Wow Just wow."
"""24 inches of ice""  Canadians use inches?"
I'm Canadian and these people sicken me.
That accent is incredible.
This is how Canadians are born
We're ALL like that. 
"Canadian, can confirm this is a normal saturday"
"Can confirm this is how they do it.

I love the Canadian accent. 
they have nothing on Buffalo NY right now
"Canadian here. Sorry, but that's just stupid. The video was made to get attention and to try to buy into a stereotype. These are probably the only people in Canada who would do such a thing."
That is so dagerous.
fuck i miss that country. everyone i met over there was a total hero.
As a Canadian.. I don't get it...? fish not by the point.. ya so?

"Obviously staged, but I don't think it matters"
"Can confirm, this is what we do."
But why does the kid have an Irish accent?

"I mean if the guy didn't like the NFL that's one thing.. because doing something for love is pretty awesome.

But $37M could have bought a LOT of sweet potatoes. "
This guy.. just beautiful man &lt;3&lt;3
he can still walk and string a sentence together. he got out of the NFL with more than most people do. He is a smart man.
I don't have an emotional reaction to many videos but this one got me in the feels.
thats so fucking dope
That's pretty fucking cool.  Good on him.
"[""It's the most beatiful thing I've ever seen""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QucyLEU6Tkg)"
"I have respect for the guy. This country needs more farmers. He basically said, well I don't have to worry about money anymore, what should I do? And he used that opportunity to make one more farmer for this country, god bless him for that. "
This guy is my hero. 
"Well, normally I'd bash the God crap, but damn. Can't hate on that. I wish more religious types could hit it out of the park like this man. ""Here, have a potato! God loves you and I love you"". I'll accept that. "
Redditor finds cool link earlier in the day. Has never found an original link in his life. Posts the earlier one. 
I dunno this isn't very shocking to me.  Everyone thinks pro athletes are just rich and have all this money.   You need to factor in that your average NFL career lasts maybe 4 years?  Your average NFL salary is between 1.5 and 2 million a year.  A lot of contracts are incentive based with a lot of fine print.  It's pretty easy to see how these guys go bankrupt after they are out of the league. 
"""Love is the most wonderful currency that you can give anyone.""

This guy is fucking awesome.  

"
This is some beautiful shit
"Well. If I had 37 Million Dollars in my pocket after doing my five year contract, I'd go and do what I love too."
Using youtube to learn how to farm sounds like a terrible idea.
Who doesn't want to own a farm? Seriously. It's expensive as fuck but very profitable and you'll have a huge property that you can do whatever you want with.
Did he play Farm Simulator also? =)
"Maybe he just saw Interstellar before it was released and he wanted to get in on that farmer action before everyone else. 
"
"""I Always Wanted To Be A Baker"""
"""...holding is still a penalty""

Could you all hear my eyes roll on that line?"
I love that guy 
/r/MadeMeSmile 
What a guy!
Take me with you ._.
"""The world didn't run out o football players... it ran out of food."""
Hall of farmer 
"Woah, woah, woah....Sweet Potatoes *are not* a fruit.

0/10 reporting."
"""God cares about the NFL""
WOW, so much cringe."
"Great video.

What's the kid on the left doing at 2:04?"
All the Respect in the World to this guy!
I cant believe how many people are making an issue out of the fact that he had a sizable net worth.  So because he left the NFL with millions his good deeds are somehow marred?  People fucking love Bill Gates who left Microsoft with billions and uses it to help people.  Regardless of whether or not he had money he is using it for good and that is the bottom line.  Dude could be driving down the streets wiping the tears of the homeless with 100 bills and instead hes helping feed people.
"At first glimpse, I was expecting to see this was from The Onion."
"I know a lot of people pat this guy on the back for doing what he loves, but I can tell you, it's probably a bad idea.

Hopefully he's still sitting on NFL money so he can pay for service workers, because to run a farm you don't just have to be good at all the things that go into crop management and livestock management, you also have to know how to do random electrical work, woodworking, vehicle repairs and just general handiwork. 

My grandfather owned a dairy farm for many years. When he finally decided to up and sell it, the only guy who put in a good offer had never run the farm before. The guy spent the next year calling my grandpa almost daily asking for help with this, that and the other thing. He was fortunately good to the guy because he wanted to see his old business succeed, but trust me, even people with degrees in agriculture will struggle with a farm unless they're good handymen and have hands on experience."
He'll probably live 30-40 years longer because of this choice.
"I mean, yes, I'm sure its much easier to drop everything to pursue what you want after making millions of dollars; but that doesn't mean what he's doing isn't noble, and amazing. Good on him."
"Relevant?

TIL James Spader has a second job as TV reporter
Hopefully someone with experience beyond Youtube is helping him out.. It'd be a shame to see his efforts go to waste. 
"Hasn't Farming Simulator sold millions of copies? I honestly think that a lot of people have this innate urge to just farm and harvest things, it gives you a really simple sense of satisfaction. I remember that feeling in Harvest Moon after picking all my crops and shipping them off in the mailbox."
"""apparently holding is still a penalty"" 
"
"The NFL pumps it's players up with drugs and sends them on the field like cattle, while hiding the fact that their sport causes severe crippling brain damage. This guy was smart as fuck to get in, make money, and get out."
"Very cool, farming has become a lost art and is not easy."
Do people really want to eat sweet potatoes though?
"Why not take the paycheck and hire employees to do the farming. Creating jobs and feeding the poor. Why does it always have to be god why cant you do it because you want to, cant you just serve yourself? "
Imagine what a different world we would live in if every pro athlete retired to a life of servitude?
"Seems like a great guy but wouldn't it have made more sense for him to play football and use the money for good?

I mean someone else will just take his place and make millions every year whereas he could let farmers farm and help them with the costs."
"But he could've served much more with all the money he could've made, no?"
"The little brother has no idea how to nod, hilarious."
I love how they keep looking at each other to corroborate stories. 
"I love when the dad asks if they should have timeout and they look at each other and sorta decide telepathically that, no they should not have timeout."
"""You guys got paint *everywhere* downstairs""
.

.

.

""yep..."""
"""Do you have any paint on you?""

*Shakes head*"
"You laughed, we're off the hook!"
"""Who's gonna clean it up""

*Older brother head-gestures and points to younger brother*"
"I like how at 0:40 the smaller kid was like, ""Bro...you are ratting me out?"""
"I  love that the younger one totally agrees to clean up the paint and denies the older one had any involvement.  As a kid, I took every opportunity to rat out my older brother."
"I think we can all agree there is most certainly ""something funny""."
"""What is funny diddy?"""
"What is funny?

Nothing's funny."
"This is why I would make a horrible father, I would just laugh at my kids mistakes.
"
I love how the older brother is old enough to use body language to tell his brother something but is not old enough to realize that someone who he doesn't intend to read the body language can easily do so as well.
It seems there were tears of horror when older one saw his dad's face at first.
Little brother is gonna be an engineer AND a lawyer. He built the stairs to get the paint. Then he compromises no time outs in exchange for juice restrictions. 
"I just love the way the older one says ""Daddy."" I think these brothers are super cute."
"&gt;You guys are goin' to bed with no juice.

Reported for child abuse."
"""You guys are gonna be in a time out, you know that, right?""

*older brother shakes head vigorously*

""Ye-""

*looks at older brother*

*shakes head vigorously*"
HE GOT IT ALL OVER HIS BEAUTIFUL SHIRT
"Big bro is like ""Dude chill the fuck out until I can figure out how much trouble we're in. He's laughing, there might be hope for juice still"""
@ 0.35 holy crap the kid can actually speak. am I the only one who thought the kid couldn't speak until 0.35?
"Seems like it's posted by a Junkin-type group. Can any of you professional interneters find the source? In other words, where's the Dad's actual YouTube channel?"
"Dad: Who got the paint out?

Older Brother: *Nods head towards younger brother*

Younger Brother: *facepalm*

That was the funniest part of the video."
Juggalos: they start earlier.
"**Yahoo, Huffingtonpost, Buzzfeed, and all the others who will steal this, be sure to give this guy credit you lazy, no original content having bastards!!!**"
This'll be on Ellen within days.
"""Who took the paint out?""

Older brother gestures his head towards younger brother

""How'd he get the paint out?""

Older brothers thinks of excuse... Makes silent motions with hands, ""He.. built a stairs...""

""He did? He built a stairs?""

""Yes, daddy.""

""With what?""

""With blocks.""

Oh, brother. "
"Oh man.

I wouldn't be here today had I done something like that as a little kid. Not saying it doesn't happen today, which it does, but those kids are incredibly lucky to have such a loving and understanding dad."
a still from that video would make one hell of a christmas card.
What deddy?
"I am convinced that when my dad used to yell ""Go to your room! We'll talk about this later!"" It was to prevent exactly this kind of reaction. He was probably laughing his ass off while I was waiting for the lecture to end all lectures."
Annnnnd there is an even younger one downstairs crying. Daddy mentally cracked because Daddy knows that Daddy was the one that made the things that made the mess.
Man that dads wheezing lungs makes me out of breath!
I feel like I'd start laughing if I was scolding my kids as well. It just seems so silly sometimes. Like it's too much.
"For the first 30 seconds, I thought they were mute."
They got paint all over their awesome shirts.
Awe man. Bed without juice. Kids have it rough nowadays.
"The way they say Daddy, melts my heart. I want kids... But first, a female companion :("
"[This feels like it should be one of those ""thug life"" videos](http://imgur.com/R8YjP8e)"
In 10 to 15 years (likely even less) this video will be one of the most cherished pieces of this family's history. It will bring joy all around when fawning over family memories.
he can ground them . but he can never take . . . their FREEEEEEEEEDOM!
"I love the little brother.

DENY EVERYTHING.

....until big bro nods yes. Then admit guilt."
"One of my favorite childhood stories is when I made my dad laugh while he tried to punish me when I was 4 or so.

I wouldn't go to sleep. Refused. He came in with a belt and slammed it hard on my bed. He never hit me with a belt, and I knew it. I had only been spanked maybe once or twice. He said ""do you know what I'm going to do if you don't go to bed!?!""

I just looked up at him and in the most smartass voice I could muster, I replied ""what, spank my bed?"" He started laughing his ass off, left the room in tears, and didn't punish me."
Woody Harrelson?!
Kids these days must be pretty sick of seeing the other side of a video camera/phone..
Did you guys hear the baby in the background? Bless these parents
You ruined your beautiful shirt!
His little brother copies everything he does. So adorable.
"At the end you can hear another one, OMG good luck Dad. Best philosophy - sometimes you have to sacrifice good parenting for humour. Glad the Dad has a sense of humour. "
I'm gonna see this all over Facebook in two days
"AH the days when no juice before bed was the worst consequence
"
I love how you can see the tear marks on their faces where the paint washed away. They look like sad clowns.
"Can relate.

These two left white footprints all over the concrete for a few years..was sad to see the prints disappear. My darlings are now almost 14 and 12.5

Luckily this was ceiling paint and was water soluble.

http://imgur.com/13qzeYp

I wasn't even mad (bro)"
"in my hair,on my face  tehee"
He should have told them they would be stuck looking like that forever now.
The most frightening words from a parent - no more juice!
Big brother's obvious tear tracks tell me he's a talker.
Yass Deddy
WHAT IS FUNNY
***NODDING INTENSIFIES*** 
These kids are ready for the forests of 'Nam. 
"I love youtube. I am able to get all the benefits of parents having children, without having to waste money on them, trouble cleaning up shit like the father will have to in the video.

"
With a beautiful shirt on. They knocked mom's spider thing down too.
The BEST part is when the big brother ratted on the little one and he fuckin FACE PALMED. It goes to show he knows EXACTLY what the bro code is and how his big bro just threw him under the bus.
"I used to be a live-in nanny for my little cousins when they were 4-5.

The shit they did sometimes was incredibly messy and yet their reactions were so unbelievably hilarious that I couldn't scold them properly.  To boot,  a fair portion of the time they just wanted to help or do something nice.

The day they tried to let me sleep in AND make their mom breakfast in bed was... I mean... ""mommy likes wine and bologna""  is sound logic, if hilarious at 8 am... But why did they think she needed their gummy vitamins?   And where did they get the idea to put eggs in the toaster oven?

Sometimes no matter how big the mess they make is, you can't keep it together long enough to let them know what they did was wrong because it's just so, SO hilarious. "
"Plot Twist:

I WANNA SEE DOWNSTAIRS NOW!
I think we've finally found Pete and Repeat here today. 
I wanna see what the room downstairs looks like
"The sigh of guilt after ""Who's the big brother?"" "
The older one looks like a koala bear.
"This reminds me of the time my little brother and I made a mud pit by ""accident"". See, it started out as this network of open trenches for some pill bugs we found. We were making them a house! But then the great flood happened, resulting in a sold 4ftx4ft mud pit.

Things got messy, you could say a mud fight happened. Unfortunately it got dark and we had to go inside, those were the rules, street lights come on, your ass better be in the house. So we strolled up to the front door, head to toe covered in half dried mud. Who was there to greet us at the door? Mom. She was sooo angry! Made us come inside, stay on the tile by the front door, she didn't want mud all over the carpet. Made us strip down and head to the bathroom to wash the mud off.

That mud pit was totally worth the lecture!"
"""You guys got paint everywhere""

""Define paint deddy"""
I don't think I've laughed harder at anything this year than I did at the death glare at 2:33
"lol the blank expressions on their faces, with the paint, and the hilarious head movement of the younger one. I wouldn't be able to keep from laughing either.
"
[Next thing these kids will be getting into the treats.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ISzf2pryI)
OP: I want to see the rest of the house!! 
This sounds like the guy that scolded Denver the dog. 
This is how I feel when I'm stoned
"I love how the little brother keeps changing all his nods so he can be nodding along with whatever the big brother does. Meanwhile, big brother just keeps selling the little one out. So funny."
http://i.imgur.com/F4STGFs.jpg
This makes me want to go back in time and be a better brother. 
"Oh man how I miss being a kid, where your punishment for fucking up is no juice before bedtime. "
Honest question:  Does every popular video always have those troll accounts with the Fedora wearing guys. I see them comment on literally every video from reddit.
he has to crack up. can you imagine dealing with these two little guys on a daily basis without a great sense of humor? brothers in crime man.
Time out? No juice? My mom would've whopped my ass with a power chord!
http://imgur.com/mcvkvWf
"Seriously, that's the punishment? My mom woulda spanked me. Kids get off so easy these days. "
This... This is the moment a father finally snaps. I remember this reaction well.
The way Brother looks as his older brother snitching.... so awesome.....
The little one looks like if the Hulk and Monet had a love child. 
"I, for one, am simply glad that video cameras were virtually unheard of when I was a kid. All of the times I did things like this are lost to the ages."
"‚ÄúYour brother did?‚Äù

*Older brother nods*

*Younger brother shakes head*

I died"
LOL this is hilarious.. little bro is too cute he has no clue how to nod correctly 
"I love how the dad laughs and that kids are like ""what's so funny""."
"""Do you have any paint on you?""
Brother number two shakes his head no"
"Big brother snitches on little brother, tells little brother how to answer.. sounds like my older brother."
"This video reminds of Louis CK explaining how to raise kids.

Youtube commenters are among the most annoying and dumbest fuckin people on earth. Almost as dumb as the people that respond to these idiots everytime a video hits front page

"Little bro got paint all over his good shirt
(YA DING A LING)"
They look like they're ready for their sniper mission
Too funny
These kids will be on Ellen by the end of next week.
They remind me of minions from Despicable Me.
They look like camo face-painted and blood-drenched veterans of the zombie apocalypse. It's all there. Even the [thousand yard stare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand-yard_stare).
Wish juice held sway over my kids.
This looks like a job fir Adrian Peterson-Man!
"Sometimes, the hardest part about parenting is not laughing at your kids. "
This looks like it is straight out of Step Brothers! 
Looks like a young Wayne and Garth.
This video is tooooooooooo funny. God I love kids they're the best
That was so freakin' cute.

"As soon as you laugh, you give up all the power."

just figured out my Halloween costume for next year
I came here for the mess...
You can hear the mental breakdown in the Dad's laugh. Poor guy.
"Those kids suck at getting their story straight, they always answer the opposite of each other :)"
"""Yes deddy"""
I dont get it. What happened? (Source: Im baked like a potato)
gotta hand it to them they chose a good camouflage combination. but a bad hiding spot.
anyone else thinks he sounds like Mr.Anderson from southpark
Next weeks Ellen show. These kids. 
This just made me giggle. I needed that after a tough Mon... oh wait it's Tuesday. Ugh.
"All the way up to 0:35 it seemed as if they were little army men with face paint, using hand lingo to communicate."
"As a mom of two little minions about the same age, I can confirm that their dad would DEFINITELY be laughing his ass off....

I would have loved to see/hear Mom's reaction to this disaster!!!"
"This is a guy that is trying to be a ""father figure"", he knows how hilarious this situation is and can't keep a strait face, I love it."
The dad sounds like Randy Marsh
This video makes me want to have kids
"Please! Someone needs to make a gif of younger brother nodding no, the older brother yes, then the younger brother correcting himself and saying yes towards the end of the video! This was hilarious!"
I've been there.....I can only imagine the mess they made
"""Wht, ddy?"""
"Maybe they just wanted to celebrate holi :)

"Good lord, I love how they put the full weight of their bodies to nod or shake their heads. It's a total needless expense of the bodies resources and that is hilarious. "
It looks like those kids had one hell of a good time!
Well they're gonna be on Ellen.
"Laughs once while scolding them as kids...

...aaaaand they're in jail."
They're just like monkeys..
"I'm guessing this is one of those times as a parent where you want so bad to laugh, but you have to hold back as much as you can. At the same time, the little rascals got paint everywhere so you're pissed... but it's funny!

1 year later it will be hilarious for the parents.

When the kids grow up to be young teenagers it will be ""embarrassing"".

When the kids are in college they're all going to be laughing their asses off at this together.

I love these kinds of things!"
I think little kids are just drunk all the time. 
Someone please recreate this with adults. *Please...* **PLEASE.....**
I lost it at the older brother's sigh. Omg yes.
I like how they began to talk after they hear their dad laugh.
"What's funny?
Am I a clown to you?"
Reminds me of my older brother and I. 
/r/contagiouslaughter
this saved my day after hard work. Thanks
Hahaha I can't wait to have kids... I say with a grain of salt.
That kid in the back is so adorable.
Lets hope he kept the shirts the way they are with all the paint and I'd frame them! 
I was a little afraid at first that this was one of those kid-shaming videos (which I can't stand).  But this dad is clearly not shaming them.  What a funny and sweet memory he captured.  Hopefully the paint in the other room comes out.  
Fuck bitches get juice
My heart just melted watching these little angels. O man. This is total blissfulness. Enjoy these moments!! No money in the world can buy this joy and mischiefs and cuteness of kids. God bless you!
"This is more or less exactly what two brothers are like, growing up. The mess, the corroboration -all of it. I should know, I'm the elder one, and we were a massive pain as kids."
I lost it at 0:52 seconds.  You can see little brothers reaction to the dry paint on his eyelids and whole face.  His reaction... hahaha! 
This is one of my biggest fear about being a dad: laughing too much when my kids do something inappropriate. 
....and you can hear a baby crying in the background at the end.  This diddy's got his hands full.
"I feel old, because my ass would have been whooped like no other if that were me in those kids shoes."
"Haha, when the dad starts laughing, the older brother looks at him like he just got out of jail for murder."
Those kids have the body language of gorillas. 
I cracked upped the moment the video started lol.
Ah the classic dad not watching the kids. 
I guess I'm missing the part where he cracks up.
All over your beautiful shirts ya dingalings
"the younger one looks like a faun, the green paint makes some awesome horns "
Sounds like they have another one growing too!
younger brother is a green-eared spaghetti monster
"They're adorable and they act/react exactly like my 2 boys (now 4 and 7 years old) when they mess with paint and other shit.

Be proud of them, they're cute :)"
"Those kids are fricken adorable. Especially the way he says ""deddy"""
Isn't it obvious this is staged? Who goes and grabs their phone or camera and starts filming when they are about to tell their kids off?
No jews for you tonight.
This is hilarious! You should post it over at /r/ContagiousLaughter 
Nigga' aint gettin no jews.
Manipulation 101
"this is a billion times funnier if you're a dad.

i have two boys 8 and 6 who pull this all the time. someone earlier asked why the dad just didn't explain to his kids why it was funny. the answer is if you show weakness, or approval, you are in essence condoning their behavior (in their eyes) and that gives them permission to do it again or possibly negate the lesson of actions vs. consequences. just my take."
How are these kids not laughing their asses off?! 
"They just wanted to be ninja turtles.

I marked my whole face up with black sharpie to be mickey mouse when I was younger."
No juice tonight. Damn.
the older brother reminds me of a koala
[Death stare)](http://youtu.be/uVDNNoEk4PI?t=2m45s )
"Kids like, ""What do you mean I'm funny? Funny how?""."
Let the countdown begin until it's on Ellen
I don't know how parents do it.
those kids run the show.
i like how the little brother is just like nope...nope...uh sir? sir i believe theres a mistake
"I don't know how I feel about recording yourself getting on to your children,  I feel like I wouldn't take my dad as seriously as I did if he did shit like this.

That being this was the perfect mixture of adorable and hilarious "
"Well after all, denying them juice before bed is just about the worst thing a parent could possibly do to punish bad behavior amirite? Clearly these kids are upset and will learn their lesson."
"Little brother just made me giggle!
You do know this is a weapon for future use."
THIS is parenting done right.
"Does anyone else think that the first time he laughed, he sounded exactly like Archer?

It's at 1:49 for those curious."
Reminds me of Arnold in Predator... DOOO IiiiiITTT DOOO ITTTTT.
I would pay big money to watch the reaction of them watching this 15 years later
2:24 was an interesting laugh LOL!
This guy sounds exactly like the trolling porn stars guy on efukt.
"I can't wait until this video pops up on Reddit in 14 years with a title of, ""My younger brother screwed my g/f so here's him with paint on his face when we were kids"""
The little brother looks like an alien with two green antennas loool cute kids
they look like koalas
No juice forever!
"I painted my dad's motorcycle when I was two. That's probably what I looked like, too."
That little guy was just nodding his head like he had no fucking idea what was going on.
Am I the only one wondering why he's filming this? And why the kid's aren't  wondering why he's filming it?
"This guy's voice sounds exactly like this guy's voice. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ISzf2pryI

I really wonder if it is the same guy. Now it's gonna bother me. Heh."
Dad was pretty cool about the whole thing.
Is this the original uploader's channel?
Haha the dad is sending them mixed messages trying to talk about punishment while not containing his laughter. It would of been so hard to inflict punishment with a straight face. 
This will be on the Today Show on t-minus 9 hours
"Man, this dudes breathing behind the camera makes me feel like I need to catch my breath."
"Good parent, talks things through, reasonable punishment etc.

Now imagine Adrian Peterson's idea of reasonable discipline. :("
Thank god camera phones weren't around in the early 90s for my scolding sessions. The fact they know they fucked up and dad is laughing maniacally probably terrifies them lol 
I like how the little brother follows what big brother says. He changes his nods after seeing what big brother says. It's super adorable. 
This is incredible. I'm surprised the dad was able to keep from laughing that long 
The dad sounds like the guy that trolls wannabe pornstars on eFukt.com
"ITT:""I love how... """
I'm gonna be a terrible father. I wouldn't be able to compose myself. 
That kid gets the same look my niece gets when she realizes someone isn't taking her seriously.
We want to see the rest of the mess! Give us what we want or else. 
Nothing like laughing at your kids to get them to hate you.
Plot twist: That's not paint they were there when Shrek popped Fionna's cherry
This is why I wanna get fertility tested at the age of 19.
"I was kind of waiting for the dad to turn on the shower while they were sitting there, but it never happened. "
"Ovaries: Kids are so cute. GIVE ME TWENTY

Me: Shhh, shhh, ovaries, it's ok."
Anyone else think the dad sounded like Bob Odenkirk? [Clip](http://youtu.be/p4Bv56zXt7Q?t=33m) for reference. @33:00 for mobile users.

"The dad trying not to laugh reminded me of the Key &amp; Peele sketch ""Manly Tears"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZPC0j-f2tU"

"Dallas, Texas"
"Dad must have had at least an hour to cool off.  Either that, or he has the longest fuse known to man.  I'm looking at this video already freaking out about their white tile in the shower.  "
It's so cute how the little brother changes his responses to match the older one's. 
what is funny? hahahaha
I wonder what the house looks like.
No juice!!!
"That shit from like 3:15-3:22 when the kid starts laughing and then puts on a ""I'm going to snap your neck"" look is the stuff of nightmares."
"Younger brother's looking at older brother like ""you fucking snitch"" "
"That would actually be some pretty badass warpaint, especially on the younger one. 
"
"Are they OP's kids? would like to see the damage they did downstairs, can only imagine with the amount of paint on their faces lol."
"Awwww, they;re good kids.

Glad poppa sees the funny side. Sounds like a cool dad."
"I don't even want kids, but this makes me want kids."
The struggles of being a older relative lol
that big brother is a liar. lol
Guy sounds exactly like that guy on the Wannabe Pornstar Trolling on Efukt
"Rofl at the kid's face at 2:36. ""Gettin' real tired of your shit, daddy."""
"""yes diddy"""
I would bring them to the car wash and then put an add on craigslist to find a good home for them.
They look like a young Dana Carvey and Mike Myers. 
As a parent... I know how hard it is to keep a straight face in times like this!  They're so cute!  Messy... but cute :)
Sometimes you just have to laugh because sometimes kids do things so unfathomably ridiculous it is either laugh or strangle them... you can always replace the things. You kind of grow to understand that with kids there is potential for disaster.
"I use to do this as a child with water colors. Boggles my mind why my Mother took them away, or maybe she did and I would find them. I do remember she sat me down and told me paint was for paper and no skin. My artistic skill comes from my Mother sitting me down and showing me the ""correct"" way to use paint/makers/crayons. However I've always had a fascination with color on skin (tattoos). "
That laugh...
Red Rum...Red Rum
"I have a fraternal twin, and i know they're not twins but just close in age, but anyone who has a brother this close knows that was not misguided nodding but collusion! They were clearly in on it together! They're definitely in big trouble."
"""What is funny"" 
Lol lol lol
"
I love how the little brother always started nodding the opposite way of his older brother until he looked at him. This will teach them to work on their stories! Too cute. 
Moments like this are why we have kids.  We're expecting our second boy in a month.  Can't wait to see what kind of trouble they get into!
Imaginw what it would be like to interct with your kids without someones well meaning motivational techniques destroying your relationship.
That's a cool dad
Ha you can see the big brother's dried tears 
"Man, they totally could have gotten off when the dad was laughing, then the big brother started laughing and you could tell the dad was thinking, ""YOU CANNOT HAVE FUN HERE! I AM THE ONLY ONE IN THIS ROOM ALLOWED TO LAUGH RIGHT NOW!""

The throws..."
Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as children.  That's all I could think of while it was playing.

i want to see these kids clean up that god damn mess
wut deddy 
"little bro was looking down when big bro pointing down, hilarious!"
I'm all about that paint bout that paint bout that paint.....no trouble. 
They look like oompa loompas!
"I once took a fuckton of my dads neon paints (not easy washable kids paint, may have been for screenprinting actually) and painted all over half a block of sidewalk outside our apartment complex.  He said it was the one moment of my childhood he found too cute to be mad at me for, despite having to scrub at it forever and get a housing violation, and the moment he most wished he had photographed.  Video is adorable :)"
Aww.. They got paint all over their beautiful awesome shirts. 
"You are the man.   Thank you, this is what discipline is!  Your lil boys clearly knew what was up.  Thank you for your post.  I had a similar instance with crayons on a wall.  They (my son 4 and nephew 6 pointed at a masterpiece they created w crayons on the wall)  I quickly pointed out the wrongness and they quickly understood the magnitude of the situation.  They both in unison played like the sky had fallen and in turn, became angels!  Angels that would listen to me!"
Reminds me of my younger brother and I when we'd make a mess

These two should get a memes
Just keep pressing 4 during the video.
"Is there anything beneficial to a child's development when you try and hold them accountable for their younger siblings? Besides trying to make their own lives easier, I don't see the end goal of a parent attempting this."
"This would so be my future kids lmao except I'm a crafty person so it'd be the whole deal, like glitter, glue, feathers, paint, and all kinds of things lol 

I love how he tries to tell his dad that his younger brother built stairs to the paint with blocks though, best part!"
wow look at all this mischief. Back in my good old days my father would take out his belt and discipline me whenever I misbehaved and never did it again. 
These kids are lucky they don't have Adrian Peterson as a dad.
"This is fake, look at that pro eye outline. Get it tricky video makers!"
they're all about that bass .... 'bout that bass ... big trouble ... 
"Oh my gosh, that little boy laughs exactly like Boo from Monsters Inc!"
Holy shit they're adorable 
Shit happens. My kids have done stuff that I had to go into the next room and crack up. Kids get into trouble.

Who gives their kids juice before bedtime anyway? :s
they're little monkeys with that face paint
"Sorry, I'm unaware of the concept.  What's a ""timeout"" in this context?"
I would love to see the basement!
"It might be the paint, but the big brother has the ""little psychopath"" look to him."
Everything about this video looks fake to me.
Those kids should be in Hollywood. 
There is something not right with those kids.
"Guess they were trying to play ""army men."" Did this when I was little too. Thought I was the coolest person ever.  Went out in the field by my house and hid in the grass thinking no one could see me. "

They appear to be covered in war paint.
"those kids are adorable, they remind me of my niece"
"HAHAHA, I applaud you OP, you held it together for so long. I couldn't hold my laugh in for more than a minute. Those two daredevils and the paint on the face, absolutely made my day!

This is great camo. Just not for the bath. 
What did it look like downstairs!
"Hilarious video but it would be so confusing to the kids.

I can understand the situation but by laughing he turns it from a serious talk to a less serious situation. You can't laugh to a child and then not expect them to laugh."
"""In my face?""

Yes but don't worry, not much. "
This is seriously amazing! And worrying too because we are expecting our fist baby :)
"No one else wanted to see the faucet turn on?

Thank you so much for this. 
at the end it sounded like there was another baby downstairs.  i couldn't imagine that much responsibility. 
"And yet again, the youtube comments are completely destroyed by idiots. I'm not convinced it's not just redditors writing that garbage now, not 9gaggers or whoever else it's been claimed to be."

thats a very loyal wee brother he has
Looks like a couple brothers are going in the penalty bocks tonight with no juice.
The 'le reddit' army is getting the fuck out of control.
There was no scolding in that video 
"""we did it for a show""
"
The 4chan commentators are shiny golden gods . 
Eyes of serial killers.
Anyone else notice they had basically the same face paint? I'd like to imagine they were painting their faces for war... Something me and my little brother always did 
"I don't know why it bothered me but he kept on referring to the kid in the back as ""brother"" and not ""your brother"". Unless the kids name was brother but that would bother me even more."
"And yet another edition of ""Faked For Fame""."
My brother and I never did this shit. You can tell these kids have no discipline and I even think the older one might have a mental disability.
"So tired of this crap-parenting.... Oh look my kids were bad, lets take a video of it for internet points.  
   "
Dunno why its not said already but this is pretty fake... the way theres no paint around their eyes?
"Is this what we do now?  We film ourselves trying to scold our children?  I'm really not getting it...

**edit:** Didn't actually expect the downvotes.  I realize my post was worded a little snidey.  That being said, I'm seriously and legitimately confused about this.  All I see is a mixed message for the child.  The scoldings are oftentimes half-hearted, yet the parent will use strong words, even laughing at times.  I might just be a weirdo who finds it cringe-worthy."
That laugh at 2:24 kind of horrifies me.... what is that?! It's like a war cry... 
"The big bro must have an enormous brain, and can also hear a fly fart."
Anyone have the original link for this?  It's clear from the YouTube description that the video was stolen just for their own benefit giving no credit to the original poster.
2.23 is the funnest part when the dad cracks.
"They're just getting ready for Vietnam, come on dad. "
This kind of stuff scares me away from ever having children.
I remember scoldings being much louder and painful on the rear. 
"Hate to be ""that guy"" but, the paint is just magically the safe distance from their eyes..."
my wife would come home and find us all covered in paint

Really confused by the popularity. That was a dead boring four minutes for me...
"I'm prepared for the downvotes, but this is very likely fake.

A couple of kids playing with tons of paint, when they know they shouldn't be, wouldn't have the foresight to wear GOGGLES.

There is a clear ring around both their eyes where they wore goggles to keep the paint out their eyes. You see it all the time in gory movies and cheap TV shows. I'm betting that the Dad just splattered them with paint, which is why they are reacting so confused and the utter lack of shame or fear. 

Combine that with the fact that this YouTuber just seems to steal other people's shit, I really wouldn't be surprised if he made this up or just nicked it off someone else."

"Wow, I actually had to stop watching around 2 minutes because of how terrible I felt for these kids and how angry I was at the parents. 

They seem initially terrified over being left alone for ""who knows how long"" and acting like toddlers? These aren't 8 year olds and that didn't happen in a few minutes. Where were the damned ""parents"", the ones that should have been watching toddlers that have access to paint, apparently?
