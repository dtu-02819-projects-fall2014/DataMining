Funniest thread I've read all week. 
*squirrel*!
"I like to think he's been training for years, secretly waiting for his opportunity to completely blow it all just to gorge on treats for 60 seconds."
And the owner has now learned to properly feed the dog.
"He trained for months for this.  Not for the performance, but because he knew there would be treats.  And it was glorious."
"Can confirm. I was walking my Golden without a leach for weeks, then out of nowhere my dog turns around. He gave me this puppy-eyed look like he sincerely sorry about something. 

I knew exactly what he was thinking. He ran off and I found him 30 seconds later in a neighbors barn, trying to raid a stash of old bread. 

He knew about that stash for months. He build up the level of trust for weeks, while also waiting for a day my neighbors and their dogs weren't home. The cunning bastard also did it on the way back, so I wouldn't cut the walk short disgruntled with his behavior / exhaustion."
I just love it when they decide the benefits outweigh the consequences of being naughty!  It's like they have an instinctive understanding that it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.

Smart.
You should really keep your dog on a leash. 
"Keep your fucking dog on a leash. I cannot count the number of times my dog and I have been attacked by ""well behaved"" dogs being walked without leashes."
I feel  like less exercise always makes dogs act worse. I would never punish a dog like that.
My dog is like this but replace treats with her own poop 💩

"Dude's just eating everything in sight, no shame at all. "

Read this in Will Ferrel's voice.
Goddammit I would watch a movie where he voiced a stray dog on a heartwarming journey with a dickish cat voiced by Tom Arnold. 
"Him as the golden, Paul Rudd as a mangy mutt, Selth Rogan as a lazy beagle and Elizabeth Banks as the sultry cat. "
"Wait, I did too... how does this happen??"
Read everything in Will Ferrel's voice.
Is that Vladmir Putin as the ref?
"Yes, during his free time, the president of Russia works as a referee for Finnish dog competitions."
Glad he found a hobby. 
"In the past, his hobby was taking pictures of American president with his son."
Other than killing bears with his bare hand. 
"That's a myth, he actually declares half the bear belongs to him, then supplies weapons to it so it can kill the other half. Oh, and then runs it over with a tank."
"Ah, classic Putin. Putin all other bears to shame. "
I knew it.
"Hey, the pay for Presidents in Russia isn't what it used to be!"
[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnP2vj2yFgU&amp;feature=share) (English subtitles available.)
I guess you could say he was RUSSIAN for that dog to FINNISH while he was PUTIN on le Ritz! 
I think yes
"Putin would adopt Golden if not symbol of American life.

Putin like dog, dog take what he want when he like, dog after Putin own heart.  Too bad dog, too bad."
Would you say he has the [Heart of a Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_a_Dog)?
Or Lucius Vorenus.
Can confirm. My grandmother was born in Russia.
"Ask yourselves this, who really won that race?"
The dog that got the fastest time. 
well just look at *mr.scientist*
that winning dog probably only got like half a vegan dog treat because he's got to stay in shape for his next competition.
"I think you mean the shortest time. Can one time really be faster than another? I think not.

Myth BUSTED"
That's how I feel studying in the same room as my ps4 and netflix. 
Or browsing reddit.
"When you say Netflix is in the same room with you, it sounds like you are talking about a god."
"No, of course I didn't say anything bad about you, netflix, I would never...what's that? Arrested? Again? But i...my macroeconomics final, netflix please...i can't! Aggregate supply is equal to...to...always money in the banana stand!"
"'yea see, she is petting me, ima good boy!"""

I almost cried when I saw the completely unnecessary slow-motion replay
"""Curl one out""  I'll be using that later.  Thank you."
"i assumed the golden was going to find the german shepard and have sex with him/her, but maybe that just shows where my mind is"
"Actually that's not a German Shepherd. It looks like a Belgian Shepherd, particularly a Malinois.

They look incredibly similar, though, and are basically the two top used military/police dogs the world."
i knew someone was going to correct me on the breed. i just assumed it was a german shepherd but i realized as i was posting that i didn't really know. 
It's a SUPER common mistake. Only reason I know is I have a German Shepherd laying on my foot and licking my ankle.. he's weird.
"&gt;particularly a Malinois.

yeah a golden retriever is a tough breed of dog to train for this race.
"In the dog's defence, the owner was speaking Finnish to him. If I can't figure out what the owner is saying, how can the dog?"
"My bf and I live in The Netherlands and have a German Shepherd. We speak English at home, so we speak English to the dog. His grandmother, upon meeting the dog, asked his mom how we ever expected the dog to behave because we weren't speaking in Dutch to it. Legitimately thought that dogs from The Netherlands only understood Dutch.

Jokes on us, dog doesn't listen to any of the four languages we speak at it."
"yeah, they pretty much go into brain dead FOOOD mode when food is involved.


it's amazing, they completely lose all control."
"We ended up nicknaming our golden retriever Hoover. As soon as food would hit the floor, she'd be there cleaning it up. When I would eat my food, she'd sit as close to me as possible, scoot forward every so often, and look at me with big puppy dog eyes, raising one eyebrow and then the other... Quite the little beggar."
"And then you'd feed her, enforcing the behavior...

Sorry, ex and I used to fight about this all the time.... never give the dog snacks like that"
Why don't you just go ahead and cancel Christmas as well? 
"Yes, might be why I'm single. Well, just one of the reasons. "
thats probably why hes single since hes basically hitler of fun
"That's insulting to Hitler, he was loads of fun."
They can be trained! 
"We had a golden, that we trained to only eat on command. We could put a tbone steak in front him with a gentle. ""No."" or ""Wait."" He would wait until we said ""Eat it."" "
"OK, I'm not trying to be rude, but you guys must suck at training dogs. Retrievers are literally one of the easiest dogs to train. Yeah they love food and will forever try to seek it out, but it's not hard to train them not to at least when you're in their presence. "
they are just the stupidest dogs. I think they are actually bred to be stupid. 
I am pretty sure they are amongst the most intelligent dogs. This dog knew exactly what he was doing.
Yep. They get a bad rep because they're very playful and non-aggressive. Well-bred goldens are amongst the most intelligent dogs.
just like you!
"In your defense, Goldens are one of the most suffering breeds from inbreeding. Breeders have kept them in ""pure"" lineages for so long, they are known to have odd cancer anomalies and can sometimes be looked at as ""dumb"" compared to other breeds that are more mixed. You kind of sucked at your comment though."
"Retrieve all the things!

Quite the golden opportunity.
It's going to be ruff to follow those puns
If you think this circle jerk is done your barking up the wrong tree.
Quit being a bitch and keep it going.
"Why a circle jerk? FUR fun, of course."

Thanks! I missed the episode where Cleveland Brown had an aneurism.
Lesson to be learned? Don't put your dog into this type of race on an empty stomach.
Golden Retrievers are never full though.
Never ever ever...aunt's golden ate an oven mitt that gravy was spilled on
Hahahaha I don't fully understand why this made me laugh as hard as it did
"It gets worse, LittleSawyer was wearing it as a cock cosy at the time."
And he put the gravy there on purpose.
"I had a German Shepherd dog that ate two sausages on a plate.

They were still frozen..."
Friend's golden snuck into the storage shed while they were away and ate the entire dry food bag. The huge one that you have to grunt when you lift it. The bag was still sealed so he ripped it apart. Had to be rushed to the vet and get his stomach pumped since he couldnt breathe or stand. 
"Yeah, mine ate a frozen 3 kilogram catfish we left in the yard to unfreeze."
My brother's golden is always full.
I think this goes for almost all dog breeds...
"Most dogs will eat until they throw up and then eat that too, dogs are never full."
"Dogs and wolves evolved to be opportunistic eaters. If they have the opportunity to eat, they will.

It's like humans and fatty foods. We evolved to have a taste for it because it was rare, but now we have easy access and eat too much."
"Does that mean that the Vegans will outbreed us cause they'll be healthy and sexy whilst we're all bloated lard balls that roll through chicken skins, bacon rinds and beer?"
"It's not exactly fair. To a dog it's like, your food is up on the table, mine is on the ground.

Well shit, someone left me tons of food all over the place. If it wasn't for me it wouldn't be down here."
My dog once climbed up onto the table to eat my dinner when I left the room for five minutes.
"Would've prefered it without the Benny Hill music slapped on top. I wanted to hear the girl's panicked ""No! Come here! Look, NO"""
"I know yakity sax gets overused alot, but this had me in hysterics. "

""Whoa, what the fuck's happening? Aw shit, man!""

""Aw man, I shot Marvin in the face!""

*screaming, as if a special guest star just arrived*

""Well why the fuck'd you do that?"""
Is there a subreddit for videos with yakity sax as background music? 
Yakety Sax makes EVERYTHING better. 
"I think the original has been posted here. Can't find it, though. And yeah, it's about a million times funnier without the music."
I think the music is what made this clip.
"The part in Finnish really makes this video:

Girl at 00:40: Here, come come come! Good!

Presenter: Esme (first dog) goes through the highway of temptations wonderfully, doesn't doubt for a se- *Benny Hill music*"
"Putin referees dog races, he can't be *that* evil. "
Well what they don't show you is that he shoots the losers at the end.
"Oh man, when his trainer comes over, haha. ""OH, A TINY SINGLE TREAT IN YOUR HAND? THAT'S CUTE. DO YOU SEE THESE PLATES BRIMMING WITH MEATS AND TREATS?!?!?! BE WITH YOU SHORTLY."""
"I've heard people sometimes refer to these as ""Golden Retards"" due to their spastic nature."
They're just jolly.  
"I don't know... my buddy Andy in high school had a gold retriever. This dog wouldn't bark unless their was food... loved strangers, and even more than his love for strangers? He loved to run across the carpet onto the tile in their kitchen and then slam into the cupboards before he could stop. Not sure why but this dog wanted to plow through everything... end tables, coffee tables, cupboards. He would just be laying down chilling, then bolt like a lunatic and just slam head first into what ever was at the end of his path. Rusty was a good boy... stupid... but a good boy.

edit: I grew up around sled dogs... slightly more intelligent, equally as quirky as golden retrievers."
"My golden story happened just recently. I was in my kitchen and my golden retriever was in there. He ran out suddenly towards my front door. I walked out after him wondering what happened when I see a stranger standing in my house petting my dog. The man opened my front door, stepped inside, closed the door behind him, and just started petting my dog. My dog didn't growl or bark, but just walked up to him playfully like it was a new friend. I yelled at my dog and he came running towards me after that. 

No longer anything to do with my dog but I should  finish the story. The man seemed to have some mental problem so we thought that maybe he got away from his caretaker or something. We got the man outside and tried to keep him there until the cops came but they were taking too long and he just decided to leave. We weren't gonna stop him and we never saw him again. The cops showed up like 3 hours later and weren't able to do anything. "
I've got a fantastic guard dog like yours. Someone walked up to my house and Jake ran up tail wagging and rolled on his back. Worst guard dog ever. 
"Rusty! My dog's name was Rusty, too! (Also a Golden)"
Most Goldens are very easily trained and if trained well will not do a lot of these things you mentioned. Ours was a hunting dog that you could take off leash in Manhattan. It all depends on how much the owner wants to train the dog. 
"Describes my ex pretty well, too."
move on poop giggle
"I've mostly heard ""Golden Retardeds"" because it has the same cadence as their real name.

Also ""Labragator"" for the snappy Labradors."
"Yea, I agree with person below. Labs are very gentle dogs"
"Former Golden Retarder owner here.

Yep."
snappy Labradors?  Do you mean they bite?  This one went over my head.  Labs are on par or sliiiightly below the lovability and need to please as Goldens. 
"If you try to give a Labrador a treat you will understand, they will take your hand of if your are not paying attention. They are not evil, just super hungry. The open palm technique was invented because of the Labrador.  "
They teeth really bad and it feels so good to have something in their mouths such as fingers and wrists. They don't bite though
"Golden Retrievers themselves actually have a high bite rate. You just don't see them reported as attacks....

Mostly because they have soft mouths, (they can pick up eggs without cracking them) so that little snap from a goldie will do less damage than from a rottie.

I like how they clap for the fact that the dog ate everything in its path and ignored its owner
"What an adorably stupid animal! The German Shepherd went straight through, but this dog just went ""OMG, BALL! FOOD! MOAR FOOD!""

I'd pet him at the end too. I'd be shaking my head, but I would pet him and give him a hug.

""That'll do, pig... That'll do..."""

You would have to chase him down and pry his jaws apart and physically remove the horse shit from them. 

It got so bad that we had to leash him to take him to do his business. He would still make a dash for the barn and then get yanked by the leash when he reached the end.

It's beyond me why someone would use an addon to browse a message board"
"You have not used RES. 
I once felt the same way. I was wrong, so wrong."
why would someone use anything to do anything
In my mobile the video started from the beginning of the clip.
"Lol why is the ""ref"" wearing stripes for a dog show. wtf, there are judges too, all hes doing is timing. lol"
If anyone wants to know what language they are talking it is sami. A european indigebous people living mostly in scandinavia.

[My personal favorite is cat vs printer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO_Ro7SMPuk)
I love [cats vs. treadmill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeYKqRRKpDo) and [cat vs. metronome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdmd5fenroU)!
[The best is cat vs. ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79qqhX8Vxc0)
"*fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck*

YouTube made me sit through a 30 second ad to see a 20 second video.
adblocker dude
Best creation ever.. 
"Ever? 

Damn. "
"It has saved me so much time on the Internet,  because I use sites like thepiratebay, YouTube, twitch "
"Mobile though, bro."
mobile got adblocker
Is there a certain app that I'm not aware of?
you made yourself sit through a 30 second ad whne you should've installed adblock. lol
Not a wise animal.
*british laughing*
"While this is really funny, ham has way too much salt for a cat to be eating. "
Why
You shouldnt give it a diet of ham...but some is fine
Has cat in username.... Seems legit
the cats vs treadmill video reminds me of [Zoolander and Hansel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwrIZQDt50)
i was reminded of that exact same scene while watching that hilarious cat video
They're like the prehistoric humans in the 2001 intro.
yes. that is the reference. 
[yup](http://imgur.com/U7Ghu2s)
"That's the referance, yes"
"""If I smack it enough times it will reveal it's secrets"""
I think they are more likely thinking they have messed up and don't want the paper to come out because they think it won't ever stop. Like those disney shows where kids are working at a fast food place and they cant get the yogurt to stop coming out and start filling cones up or other things.
I can't think of any other possible explanation. 
*Is it dead?*
"I love the end.. He's like "".... I think I killed it........ but I'm not sure......"""
That was highly entertaining
Any idea why they twitch according to the sound? 
The best thing I've seen on the internet. Literally cried laughing. Thanks for these!
The metronome one was really catching the beat there.
http://youtu.be/CSK1D3bZhRs
"Here's mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRBH21IvSrc

2 cats vs auto feeder"
That first printer sounds like a cat spitting. I wonder if that's what's causing the reaction.
"To be fair, most humans have an equally difficult time with printers."
"They are all like: ""this is not natural and I am gonna prove it!"""
Maybe cats are just really environmentally conscious.
That's a fax machine bro. That's an endangered species right there.

Bahaha this is fantastic!
"They have all of the curiosity but none of the critical thinking skills. The colloquialism should be changed to ""curiosity killed the cat because it was a fucking moron"". "
But at the same time they're also really smart. My cats always know exactly what I'm doing and they now exactly when I'm about to eat something or give them something.
"Cats seem to respond this way to things being on top of them. 

I put my kitty in a harness to try and walk her outdoors. Nope. She just crawled around as if she were crushed by an oppressive amount of weight."

"It's amazing how far this ""le gems"" counterjerk has come since it first started. It went from people not liking it when people called things ""gems"" in video to them just vigorously jerking each other off in some sort of violent rebuttal, but now it's just as annoying as the original reason was, if not more so.

"Wow, OP. That video was truly outrageous. Truly, **truly**, ***truly*** outrageous."
A true gem

I feel bad for this little cat =(
I caught a chipmunk like that once.  
Please... tell us the tale.
I'm tip-toeing in excitement
I wonder if animal control can use this technique to capture unrulely wild animals with less fuss?
"God, the YouTube comments are utter trash. I'm so tired of troll accounts."
I found a chrome extension that blocks the comments of those known trolls you are talking about. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-fedora/acjgabfifnnmmlckmnijdbijgbfpedde
"Meanwhile, this thread is full of GEM comments.."
I think the novelty accounts are kind of funny.
"They were kind at first. Now they're just annoying. 
Easily solved by not reading the comments. But still."

DAE This. You have 2 upvotes. I have 1. Half life 3 confirmed. Only 90's kids will get this. 
"You have -5 and he has 3, the equals -2, multiply that by -1 and you get 2, multiply that by a 1,000 and you get 2000, add 1 and you get 2001, the release date of half life 1 for ps2. Then take the release date for half life 2 for windows (2004) and subtract half life's release date, you get three. Half Life 3 confirmed."

Gems are always welcome on leddit. And there are so little cats on every other subreddit we really need more cats in /r/videos. Upboats bacon at midnight my good sir. 
"All these videos remind me of Zoolander:  ""It's -in- the computer...!?!?"""
"Oh, you found a gem?"
more like catching a gem with a laser gemmer
"I like at the end his ears popped up like ""I'm gonna go teach that laser a lesson!"""

I have also caught a squirrel that way. It honestly works.
Saying you found a gem just makes me want to cringe.
nice gem :\^)

REKT
The most successful use of a cat I have seen yet.
"Never liked videos like this, never understood how people could like videos like this, never expected to hear people roar in laughter in videos like this. Whenever I see my innocent, naive cat in an uncomfortable situation, I feel bad for him and rush to help him out of it."
I feel the same. It's pretty cruel. 
I completely agree with you. Though the container is removed fairly quickly the cat is obviously distressed as it runs around under it. Extremely poor taste. 
Brilliant 
RED ALERT! SHIELDS UP!

"whats the deal with all the people in the youtube comments sections saying they are redditors, is it true?"
"Yeah, they are from /r/RedditArmie."
Did someone say...**GEM??!?!?!!!**
Animal abuse comments in 5...4...3...2...
That animal abused the heck out of that red dot for years.
"If this was a dog trying to get a piece of food off a counter (say like the video that popped up here about a week ago) there would be plenty of animal abuse comments. 

Moral of the story. It's ok to tease cats, but not dogs. But in reality, the really moral, is don't expect consistency from Reddit. Sometimes the idiots come out to comment, and other time folks are sensible. "
Kind disappointed there isn't a gem storm wall in here. Is that not a thing any more?

Correct. I made a few thousand dollars licensing a video of my dog with a poorly rendered light saber.
They made an offer to license and market the video and split the profits so I took it.   For a video that has been sitting on my phone for years I figured it would be an interesting experiment.   If I ever do anything like this again i'll probably do more research but I found it a pretty entertaining entry to my first youtube video posting ever.   
Was this before of after you posted it to reddit?

What? I don't get it. I'm going back now.
"Southern Ontarian here: Fuck that. I wish I had the kind of tolerance to cold to even pretend I wasn't completely dying from weather like that.

And with that wind? God damn my nipples would be able to rip a hole in time itself so I could go back and never do that in the first place."
"And the difference just among southern Ontario is big too. Im in Windsor, about as south as you can get in Ontario, and just two-four hours north and it gets way worse in the winter. Our winters are super mild and the summer is like the carribean."
"To go even deeper. I live 40 minutes from Toronto. I can drive 5 minutes and see the skyline from on top of the escarpment. We've had snow for a couple days and yet listening to the local radio they were saying ""apparently there is snow north of the city"". My mom on her daily drive can go from snow covered ground to grass on her drive to work. "
It's from all the trash you give to Detroit to burn up for you.
"That's what I dislike about South Ontario. Everyone's like ""oh I'ma Canadian eh bud cold weather's nothing"" and they're bundling up for above freezing temperatures like it's a month long trek to Antarctica. "
"I live in southern Ontario, about an hour and a half from the border. Every year I go up to Hudson Bay for some hunting, and it really isn't that different. It's only like -20."
-20 is nothing when there is no wind.. its that -45 windchill that gets you up here in the North.
"God damn, i thought we had it rough here in Toronto"
And here I am in Texas bundling up when it's 50 degrees.
"The problem is that when you are used to weather like this, you are close to death when the weather hits positive ~35c

i'm finnish and i was on turkey last summer where there were days with something like 35c in the shade, i was literally useless, and dying sweating bullets. i'll take the cold anyday.


on hilarios sidenote, go to any common tourist trap on the winter, and the locals are wearing jackets etc, and the whitest of white finnish tourist are at the pool soaking up the sun when the temp is something like 19c ""goddamn its hot"" And they mean it."
"Canuck here. Yep. 20c is perfect for anything.

It's hot, but not heat stroke hot. I won't sweat bullets or die. Anything between 5c and 20c is awesome.

Cold over hot any day."
"Australian here... are you insane ?! I would not even try and swim if it is under 25c and that is pushing it. 30c is like the perfect temperature in aus, 20 is literally winter weather. "
Sounds like paradise. You lucky crooks. 
"Perth is unreal, in my opinion the best weather and best beaches in Australia. You have to see it for yourself :)"
"I live in Tromsø, Norway (about 67 degrees north I think) and I can confirm. Went to Denmark in summer and shit was just too god damn hot. "
"Well if you visited during the part of summer this year where we had ungodly temps I agree. A lot of us were having a hard time once the temps went above ~23-25^C.

The worst thing is that it was like that for what? 14 to 21 days. I for one had a hard time sleeping and opening up the windows helped nothing at all.

Then came a period of time where we would alternate between ~10-15^C weather and ~25-30^C weather within days of each other. That I tell you, makes it utterly impossible for the body to adjust in any meaningful way. "
This is the main reason I haven't really travelled outside my country
"In my part of Canada, we get extremes of +40c in summer and -40c in winter. The worst of both worlds."
"Ahhh, the prairies... Where you can watch your dog run away for a week after it gets out the gate."
It is like that some years in the Capital too.
"Yes, but for us, in the summer it's normally 25-30c + another 10c in humidity. That's Ottawa though: humid as fuck in the summer and so dry in the winter your hands are covered in painful dessication cracks.  "
"Pennsylvania here,  19-20c is fucking AWESOME weather where I live, we can get some 35c temps too every once in a while in middle of summer but I'm thankful for living by a river that's nice and cool even on those 35c days, swim in it and not worry about the shitty heat, but my perfect tempature is definitely 19-20c range,"
"Yeah, we only have to worry about the Chemicals in our rivers that will poision us. I remember going into the Lackawanna river as a child in black camo shorts, when I came out they were no longer black. 
"
Yeah I definitely agree with this.
Floridian here. Can confirm. Only tourists at the beach.
After a few months here in Ohio we'll get a 45° day and if pools were open I bet they would have people in them. 
"In Houston.

I wore a jacket over a hoodie over a thermal and I was still cold as fuck

It's 40 degrees in the morning."
It's 73 in Los Angeles and my wife has a blanket and the heater turned on full blast whilst I choke to death gasping for air!!!!
You should ask her to stop trying to suffocate you. 
"How does this ""asking"" thing work?"
If he's wearing a batman costume it's probably consensual 
Unless he likes that
"That reminds me of when I went to Vegas. I live in Ontario, Canada, and when my wife and I went to Vegas during the ""Off-season"", it was about 19-20°C (68°F) there.

There were scantily clad women (usually with their man's jacket on their shoulders) everywhere complaining that they were frozen and needed mitts while they stood in line to get into places. Meanwhile my wife and I were in a T-shirt and shorts absolutely loving the warm weather, having come from some -20° weather."
"&gt;73

she crazy? thats perfect weather! i wish it could stay 70-73 year round here, looooooooooooooove spring."
"4.4C repeating of course, for us Canadians.

also, really? It's in the negaitves up here and I have my nice looking not so warm coat on only haha."
"The old ""nice looking/not very warm"" coat dilemma eh"
It's known that no coat can provide warmth while looking good. 
That is a blatant lie! 
He forgot to add without costing a small fortune to his requirements 
I'm sorry :(
"&gt; 4.4C repeating of course,

at least you have poutine

"
"God damnit it, Leeroy, eh?"
"I don't know, man. I live in a really humid place since we're by The Gulf. It makes the cold bite a little more and the summers are always sticky and thick.

But god damn I love my city."
Temperature happened. Must over/under compensate.
"I think I may be the only Houstonian who loved the cold weather the past few days. Finally get to wear that nice coat I got last year. 

Waking up in to those cold morning does suck though. "
"relocated from Des Moines, Ia to Houston in August... i thought it was supposed to stay warm down here?!"
I was had a friend from Houston. One day I go to pick this dude up (he didn't have a car) and he comes out wearing a freakin' snowboarding jacket in 70 degree weather.
I grew up in Houston and the one fashion trend I never understood is when you see a guy wearing a heavy jacket and shorts. 
To keep your torso warm as you reach out the window to grab your whataburger. 
How much is that in real world temperature? 
Was -20 in Calgary last week. This week it's a tropical -2! Practically summer again!
It was 0C in Edmonton today. I'm not even being sarcastic when I say we've had beautiful weather all week.
"Hell, you're warmer than southern Illinois where it's been 19f the past two days, wanna trade?"
"15c in halifax yesterday, it's been a lovely fall so far. "
"Welcome to Calgary haha. I was so happy when I could walk to Tim Horton's in just a long sleeve shirt. It's only -2! THIS IS BALMY.

It's almost Chinook season too. -30 one day, +10 the next. Everyone's in T-shirts when that happens."
Those weather changes killed me when I lived in Calgary coming from Toronto. I had nose bleeds and headaches all year. Honestly i found it harder than having two extreme seasons. 
I feel your pain dude. Its been in the 40s in San Marcos and I'm already wearing three layers of shirts
/r/LONESTAR 
LMAO
Was -21C with the wind chill here yesterday. (-6F)
"It was 54 here in So Cal today...it was the coldest I had felt in a long time. 

Then I checked the temp and I felt embarrassed. "
Fahrenheit or Celsius?

"Naw, just something canucky."
Its funny when they all point at different directions 
Holy shit that was dangerous
"I feel like what happened here is they had two holes very close together, one of them barely off camera. The two swimmers got in, submerged under the ice for like two seconds and then pulled themselves up to get the shot of them coming out from under the ice. Everyone would have been able to see and immediately react if they went under for a moment too long. They could have had rescuers at the ready off camera for all we know. 

This is what I hope happened, for the safety of all involved. But you never know with these crazy fucking Canadians. "
"At around :26 you can hear him get in the water just off camera.

With that said, it's still pretty dangerous.  The extreme cold can shock you and confuse you in the water.  When I was a teenager I went to camp and they had us do swimming exercises if we wanted to go canoeing.  It was the middle of March in New Hampshire where the average temperature is probably between 35-45 degress, depending on where you are.  Not horribly cold but definitely not swimming weather.  I remember when I jumped in the water it was hard to focus on swimming to the objective.  I just wanted to get out.  The extreme cold puts you in a near panic.  So diving under ice is pretty ballsy."
"These guys are probably polar bears(from what my grandpa called them), they do this all the time, and they are probably used to the cold."
"Crazy ass old people here in Germany float down the rivers naked. So cold. They're just covered in hair, it's an amazing thing to see."
I need to see this... for science.
Dude.
ew
"It's true that extreme cold can shock you, but it's significantly less likely when you're already standing in the cold weather with no clothes on. That lake water will suck the heat from you much faster, but isn't actually colder than the air. It's a little cheat but it helps a lot when doing these sorts of things. Or at least I think it does, could just be superstitious."
Maybe you just aren't Canadian enough.
If you breath out when getting cold water it helps you not panic 
At :49 Right after the camera guy mentions Neil you can hear the splash as he gets into the water. 
"They're probably experienced ice hole swimmers, so they won't be shocked or confused in the water. "
"You can also see the hole where he goes in, barely a meter to the left."
"&gt;middle of March

&gt;average temperature is probably between 35-45 degrees

Oh my god, that sounds like hell on Earth."
"Or even if you don't drown, getting into the habit of diving in cold water with no ear plugs [can cause hearing loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfer's_ear)."
"&gt; they had two holes very close together

"Rescuers or not, this is fucking deadly behaviour. Currents don’t go away because a river is iced over, and you have no way of knowing if you are going to be swept away. If you lost your way back to the hole for any reason, “rescuers” are not going to have scuba gear to breath long enough to get you. Please don’t try this anyone. Video is super funny though. "
"&gt; Currents don’t go away because a river is iced over

That isn't a river, it's a lake - there isn't really a current. Not that it isn't dangerous, but it's not too bad if you're used to the shock of the temperature and don't panic."
Let em have it terry!! 
"..... Huh?

You know when you drive north they get you to put anti-freeze in your car? That comes from blood drives in Canada."
"That is why they say ""blood, it's in you to give"""
"Only if you can't break ice with your fists.

EDIT: Downvote me all you want, I'll be punching through ice with my Canadian fists and playing with some round magnets."
24 inches of ice. Lmfao
Clearly not canadian
What ever happened to Clearly Canadian?
"A Canadian could easily punch through 24 inches of ice before puberty.

"What you didn't see was their ice fishing hut. no one just goes icefishing outside that like, that's crazy. Imagine a Shed, on skis you tow out behind a snow machine. you have a small propane heater, and of course your beer cooler in side. All these guys did was cut a second hole and swim from their shack to this outside hole.

The most dangerous part here is falling in that second hole drunk haha."
"People do go ice fishing like that, but yea they probably had a shack."
Is that Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon??? hahaha sounds just like him. 
"No, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8wrY4MuX1I) is."
"This is Canada. It snows nine months of the year, and hails the other three. Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. The people that grow here are even more so. The only upsides are the pets. While other places have ponies or parrots... we have... polar bears."
"*It snows nine months of the year, and there is construction the other three."

Still, could never be one of those people that dive into the ice water.  Brrr."
You could tell he was impatient with the other diver and wanted the conversation to end so he could put on that coat. 
I dont even like to swim in water that's below 70°.

You can see them go from white in the water. To beet red when they come out.
My nipples shrunk.

and Bear Grylls tries to make it look so difficult. pffff...
"Do you have to mark the holes that you dig out for fishing, so people dont drive or fall into them? "
"There's something terrifying about the thought of being under ice like that. 

Dipping in where it's all open, with no current? Sure. It would suck but it's doable. 

Going under some ice, any ice, and coming up elsewhere? Fuck that. "
