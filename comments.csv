i didnt know how to react to a non facebook post i feel to lost 
"&gt;I'm not saying everyone should lie or exaggerate or word their descriptions to put their side in the most positive light. I'm saying they do.

Sometimes.  Sometimes they do.  What you are implying is that people are always completely biased and that, as a result, anyone who deviates from complete support of their ""side"" is indication that the other party is ""correct"".  That may be accurate in specific instances, but it's a silly generalisation to make, IMO.

&gt;Which the mother then handled by letting the entertainer perform and then refusing payment, which puts her in the wrong.

Without going back and reading the whole saga again, it was my understanding that the mother offered part-payment for partial service, which is fair (actually, I got the impression that she refused to pay the fee but tipped the mermaid half the value, though I could have interpreted it incorrectly)."
"He looks dead-on like the examiner who took my driving test a few months back, then tracked me down on Facebook using my permit details and insisted I was flirting with him throughout the test."

Way to shake it off, OP. And this is not cringe, btw."
"Because cognitive biases and in-group and out-group psychology aren't a thing, and everyone is always impartial and objective during Facebook arguments... I'm not saying everyone *should* lie or exaggerate or word their descriptions to put their side in the most positive light. I'm saying they do. 

""Given what was said"" isn't relevant; you can't tell what actually happened from what was said because they're both trying to spin their story to make it sympathetic to whoever they agree with. What's relevant is the fact that the party guest - who would naturally side with her friend against an unreasonable, late, rude, lying stranger - is instead completely understanding, friendly and supportive to the stranger. 

That very strongly implies that the stranger wasn't actually rude, unreasonable, or a liar. No one would be so friendly to someone who behaved so badly. It was just an ""awkward situation"", as the party guest herself says. A misunderstanding between the mother and the management company. Which the mother then handled by letting the entertainer perform and then refusing payment, which puts her in the wrong.

Now, it would probably be a good idea to standardize the use of commas and decimal points in numbers over the world, but there I really don't think there's a clear advantage to using the one over the other."

Looking through the comments I feel like I'm the only person who enjoyed reading the entire thing.
"Lets start at the top, you should probably look at your understanding of incestuous, the words usage and come back. You will notice that I am not saying that American parents want to commit sexual acts towards their children but rather that the abstract manner in which this cultural aspect is presenting itself has incestuous tendencies to a cultural outsider.



As for Scandinavia, it is not finland, denmark sweden norway etc. It's Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, period. And yes, the cultural similarities are so close that I would say that in general terms this does not exist in all of Scandinavia. Generalizing cultural traits is always problematic, but saying that this does not exist in all of Scandinavia is no more problematic than saying it does in the US. Both of which I find acceptable and necessary generalizations. 



It's completely unnecessary to use such strong language. But when you find the need to do so, at least know what you are talking about. Right know you just look like a fucking asshat."

Comment

Had something to do with the boyfriend and current girlfriend making a fake facebook profile to make the guys ex girlfriend upset.  This is normally a tactic used by a high schooler.

The comment ""big time drug user"" was /u/swiperboy making fun of the way that I worded that...

TL;DR The comment about 17 year olds and the comment about drug users are unrelated.

"Why do some womens world's revolve around their boobs? So annoying. My sister does that. Anyone has a problem with her, make or female, its got something to do with her boobs. Everyone wants them and can't have them. Anyone does something nice, its because of her boobs. Someone is always trying to get them. The only one concerned with your boobs is you... So annoying. And god forbid you call a woman like this out. That's a can of worms. 

Sorry OT. That was my thought. This woman is one if THOSE women. "
That kind of bugged me too. Only the facebook refs can declare a winner.
A very good point!
"Misleading, yes, but I think it's up to a buyer to know what they are paying for before they agree to anything.  I agree that its fucked up they only confirm the day before.  Both people seem like they are in the wrong."

Also, it looks like she only has a streak of blue, her eyebrows should be matching her roots, which are brown."

No way that's ridiculous
"Feels like more bullying from you, dude. I have a bachelor's degree, but I graduated from an inner city university where many of my classmates were the first in their families to do so. This isn't cringe so much as it as a reflection of the failing of our school system. Without your editorialized back story, this is just sad."
I love it
"This guy is nuts, it's my girlfriend's facebook friend.  I might make a dummy facebook profile and stir up all kinds of drama with the fake girl.  Maybe send some messages like ""You been talking to my man?""  And then add the guy as a friend and then find the origin of this fake girl and post those on his wall!

Sorry that comment was all over the place.  "

I used the same exact phrase, even. As you're not pestering the poster I responded to originally, I have to assume you either didn't bother reading the relevant comment, or were able to successfully process the meaning behind it but still decided to respond to my comment in order to display your vastly superior intellect and command of the English language.

"Yes, which also gets applied to your initial statement. You stated it as if every child will notice and comment on cleavage, I gave an opposing argument."

But when is evidence ever necessary?
"Here's the thing. Yes this is just a joke. But reports do get out of hand with many equations, tables of data, code, pictures of data, pictures of things you made and of the things you used to make the thing. It's not completely absurd to see 250+ page reports that don't have many words for a project in undergrad engineering. I've had friends do this, but the largest ones I've made are only around 150 pages."
I think it's that thing that some people do with the chisel and hammer.
"Canadian here!
The space and decimal point is how I was taught to format my numbers (and also how most other people, where I live, format them). 

Honestly, I see no benefit to using a space over a comma separating 1 000s - they both signify the exact same thing with very little difference in work done. Moreover, commas are much easier to use if you are a messy writer because one can (usually) discern a comma, whereas it is much harder for a space (is a space "" "" or ""  "", or is it just the way someone writes). Thus, it is generally a little bit easier to count units because you can just count tick marks.

Also, using spaces takes time to actually make them ""pretty"" and easily recognizable but IMO spaces look better than commas. Anyways, that's just my 2 cents.
