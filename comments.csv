"From the article:

&gt;* Why is the assumption of a bell-shaped curve so firmly established? It seems to describe rather well the distribution of certain biological characteristics ‚Äî e.g., height or weight ‚Äî as well as measures of human performance under highly-constrained circumstances‚Äîe.g., working on an assembly line or filling out a self-report survey. Moreover, bell-shaped curves have desirable mathematical properties and apparently captured the fancy of many early statisticians, who generalized their applicability beyond what was warranted."

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-good-life/201205/whom-the-bell-holds"
But then the average sight wouldn't be 20/20 or whatever.  The average would be slightly nearsighted.  Half would still fall above and below the average line.

I'd have to hunt around a bit to find some that deal with physical attributes like penis size, but I bet for example vision doesn't follow a bell curve - way more people seem to be nearsighted than far. 

ETA: yep, refractive error in vision doesn't follow a bell curve. This abstract is hella dense, but if you scroll past the text you can see some graphs.

"Alright I'm thoroughly confused after reading this comment chain. Unless the severe outliers drag the average in a particular direction, then by principle roughly half would be above the average and half would be below the average. This isn't really an opinion based dispute - it's just a property of averages. If you have any kind of curve with a roughly equal distribution, then technically about half would be over the average and the other half would be under the average. I assume that your point classifies anything really close to average as ""average"" and therefore most men would also be considered average, in which case you two are arguing different points. If the average is exactly 6 and some guy has a 6.002, then he's still technically above average. 5.998 would be technically below average. Assuming the curve is distributed about equally above and below the average then literally half of all men would be above average and half would be below. You don't need a source for that - it's just how math works."
I'm not sure what you mean.
Statistics is not historically famous for trumping reality.
Could you give an example for a large population?
"*and Knuckles, PhD."
If you have a small sample size you may be right but when dealing with an entire population it's going to even itself out over a near-perfect bell curve.
source?
Something like this would if you are using a group as large as the whole male population.
You're correct - not all ranges follow a normal distribution and there are lots of circumstances where the average (i.e. the mean) does not demarcate half of the population.
"That's really not what average means, dude. Average typically just refers to the mean. So absent a normal distribution, it is not necessarily the case that half or close to half of a population is above average."
Oh my god lollipop looks awesome. 
But not all distribution follows a normal bell curve.

"&gt; Like I said here, I disagree with this.

That's your opinion, which is fine, but IMO it is basically ignoring common-use and the fact that it is a term that carries connotations greater than the sum of its parts (*friend* and *zone*).  ""Friendzone"" has, during and since its rise to popularity, referred to a situation whereby a guy has been pigeonholed into a nonromantic context, irrespective of merit.

You are also ignoring the fact that people, while they may be able to make an initial determination of attractiveness within a few seconds, are not locked into finding someone attractive or not based on their initial determination.

I can find someone attractive, have a wank, then take another look and be like ""yeah nah.

Someone might start taking some care in their appearance, or, over time, develop their social skills and/or personality, and become attractive to someone who previously found them unattractive.

I might get to know someone physically ""meh"", and find that their personality is very attractive and that I am attracted to them despite having no initial superficial attraction.

That's not to say that anyone can be with the person they like if they try hard enough or change enough, but saying that attraction is determined immediately isn't telling the whole story."

"&gt; You are being like a delusional nice guy by not acknowledging attraction is mostly at ""first sight"". 

... That's a little pretentious. And heavily opinionated. 

&gt; Attractive guys rarely get friendzoned in their youth

This is probably the worst place to say it, but in relative terms, I've been told I am better looking than average. Will leave it at that. 

I had a nice guy stage. Because I was insecure, lacked confidence, and shifted blame on everyone but myself. Looks help in the very initial interaction with someone you like, but then the insecurity and desperation lumps out like a steam lump of ""nice guy"". End result is the same for everyone who is stuck with this stupid mentality. 

Whether you're Quasimodo or a Greek God in mortal form; unless you accept that a) the girls/guys you are going for are people, equals, and should be viewed/treated as such b) accept yourself for who you are, have self-respect and healthy self-esteem/confidence; you'll do poorly with the opposite gender. That's it. 

&gt; It's not lack of chemistry, it's lack of physical attraction, if someone doesn't like your face, that person simply doesn't like you.

Looks make it easier in the start, but they're only skin deep. Chemistry is liking the person, ""clicking"". A pretty face can get the other person interested... until you open your mouth. Then your demeanor can make/break it.

"Fair enough, but you are still mistaken. Attractive guys rarely get friendzoned in their youth, while unattractive ones will be friendzoned over and over again forever until and only IF they find someone in their level of attractiveness who will settle for what they can get, which doesn't happen early in life.

It's not lack of chemistry, it's lack of physical attraction, if someone doesn't like your face, that person simply doesn't like you. Attractiveness is close to being objective. There are personal preferences but usually within certain canons.

 You are being like a delusional nice guy by not acknowledging attraction is mostly at ""first sight"". There are countless studies that prove this."

"You have a huge misconception. No one is inherently shifting any blame by using that word. Some people do, and they say ""damn friendzoning bitches"" (in which case they aren't shifting the blame, they are just blaming someone for not liking them physically), but it's only a few guys who do that on the internet.

&gt; The friendzone gives socially awkward people 

What does ""socially awkward"" have to do here? It's about physical attractiveness. You know if you're attracted to someone within the first second of looking at them. It's a fact. 

Friendzone just means one side is physically (so, sexually) attracted and the other one isn't. It's neither's fault.

&gt; the ability to shift the blame from themselves onto the person they desire which creates some weird paradox where they hate the person they crushing on. 

This is not inherent to the word ""friendzone"". Friendzone doesn't inherently blame anyone. Friendzone just describes the situation.

I myself have ""friendzoned"" girls. It's neither my fault nor theirs.

At this point, the term itself has become pathetically overused and morphed into its own thing. The ""nice guy"" culture birthed this idiocy.

It's not a ""zone"". Its a girl not being attracted to you. *All* guys go through it.

It's not the guys fault the girl doesn't like him. **It's not a girl's fault she doesn't like him**. There is no zone, no victims, nothing. Turning it into a zone is what perpetrates the ""victim nice guy"" bullshit. And is a viscous cycle. That all guys go through, and hopefully grow out of as soon as possible. This ""friendzone"" as a term for a girl/guy not liking you is pathetic and leads these same guys (and gals) to repeat the same mistakes and self-pity. 

Lack of chemistry is a real situation. Friendzone is an excuse to mope and blame it on others. "

"I think going all the way in the other direction and saying number has literally no relevance to anything is just as shortsighted and inaccurate as saying its a very important indicator of someone's personality and grounds to date or not date them. 

Like everything else a person does, the number of partners does communicate some information about a person. Not necessarily good or bad information, but still information. 

Its not any different then paying attention to what movies someone likes or how clean their room is - it won't tell you everything about a person but it can tell you something. 


Someone whose still a virgin because they're waiting for marriage for example, the fact that they have 0 partners tells you a good deal about their upbringing probably, their values, and their expectations. 

Someone having a pretty high number also tells you a lot about them - they're probably more outgoing and social or something, and don't have a lot of hangups about sex. They're comfortable with it. 

Placing all kinds of negative judgments on a number is often inaccurate and dumb, but saying the number isn't important at all just because there's such a strong kneejerk reaction against anything perceived as anti sex around here, and you're part of the hive mind, is also pretty dumb. "
