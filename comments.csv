*If they fall off face down they go back on the pile.
*Repeat until pile is gone. Player with the most pogs in their possession wins."

"&gt;Your entire post seems to revolve so thoroughly around gender stereotyping and the assumption that men are 


Well yeah, it kind of does. 

But there are some things that conform to gender stereotypes aren't there? 

Are you so used to arguing about them on the Internet that you've forgotten that they actually exist in real life? 

Like they really are out there. 

&gt;completely uninfluenced by anything directed at women that I don't even 


No. You misunderstood. Again, you seem to be looking for an argument where there is none. 


Romantic comedies are usually films for women. They appeal to women because they have female protagonists and deal with female oriented storylines and more often than not have storylines revolving around man-child men eventually growing up enough to realise the hero is more important than hanging out with his idiot friends. 

That seems to be the template for most romantic comedy I've seen. 

The other ones involve some new guy winning her affection in some other way. 

Ok - so you don't seem to argue that's the general premise. 

So we know that appeals to female fantasies. 

And I also explained that male oriented films (usually extreme action films because that's what history has shown us men go for) 

The love interest storyline is usually simplistic at best. 

Do you agree or disagree? 

Do you agree or disagree that that appeals to male fantasy? 

'save the world, get the girl'

You could look at porn. Much of it is clearly aimed at men, and women often profess to prefer different genres of porn because much mainstream porn has unrealistic sex that appears to male fantasy. 

Again... Do you agree or disagree? 

Men are susceptible to being misled. I've heard many stories and articles about boys having completely unrealistic opinions about sex though porn. 

So in no way am I saying that men are less susceptible to anything. 

I just saying that rom coms are targeted at women, are female centric and have fantasies that lazily appeal to women which are more likely to affect women than men. 

I don't see why you're struggling with this. 



&gt;know how to respond to it.  Honestly, I started typing up a real response, but it wasn't working.  You're overgeneralizing so severely that if you don't understand how completely ridiculous statements like ""Most guys know fully well that have to work to make it happen. Impressing her, romance, being cool being rich, chasing her."" then I don't think anything I say is going to convince you of anything

The reason why you're having difficulty replying is because I don't think you completely grasp what I'm saying. 

It sounds like I'm being sexist so your instinct to argue is kicking in, but when you get down to it I'm not, and that's why you're struggling to criticise me. 

For example that last sentence you quoted. If you can demonstrate that it's false I'd love to see how. 

But the fact is in society most guys are chasers. 

If you don't know that then I think you need to get out of the house more - because it's possibly the truest thing you can say about gender roles in relationships. "
That's... adorable.

So in no way am I saying that men are less susceptible to anything. 

I just saying that rom coms are targeted at women, are female centric and have fantasies that lazily appeal to women which are more likely to affect women than men. 

I don't see why you're struggling with this. 



&gt;know how to respond to it.  Honestly, I started typing up a real response, but it wasn't working.  You're overgeneralizing so severely that if you don't understand how completely ridiculous statements like ""Most guys know fully well that have to work to make it happen. Impressing her, romance, being cool being rich, chasing her."" then I don't think anything I say is going to convince you of anything

The reason why you're having difficulty replying is because I don't think you completely grasp what I'm saying. 

It sounds like I'm being sexist so your instinct to argue is kicking in, but when you get down to it I'm not, and that's why you're struggling to criticise me. 

For example that last sentence you quoted. If you can demonstrate that it's false I'd love to see how. 

But the fact is in society most guys are chasers.

Well yeah, it kind of does.

No. You misunderstood. Again, you seem to be looking for an argument where there is none. 


Romantic comedies are usually films for women. They appeal to women because they have female protagonists and deal with female oriented storylines and more often than not have storylines revolving around man-child men eventually growing up enough to realise the hero is more important than hanging out with his idiot friends. 

That seems to be the template for most romantic comedy I've seen. 

The other ones involve some new guy winning her affection in some other way. 

Ok - so you don't seem to argue that's the general premise. 

So we know that appeals to female fantasies. 

And I also explained that male oriented films (usually extreme action films because that's what history has shown us men go for) 

The love interest storyline is usually simplistic at best. 

Do you agree or disagree?

You could look at porn. Much of it is clearly aimed at men, and women often profess to prefer different genres of porn because much mainstream porn has unrealistic sex that appears to male fantasy.

"Aye, and when you say ""press charges"" for battery, you're obviously referring to the crime. Now we're getting somewhere! I'll break this one down for you.

Time 1: So there was a comment wayyyy up there ^ that mentioned something about suing for battery. As you just mentioned, I took this to mean the civil tort of battery.

Time 2: An unrelated comment mentioned *pressing charges* for battery, i.e. the crime (again we've already established this logic). Then another poster replied to this comment talking about conviction for a crime requires intent and how no lawyer would take that case.

Time 3: I came across this third reply and mistakenly (as I've already admitted, I was mistaken due to posting on mobile) thought the person talking about intent was replying to the person talking about *suing* for battery, not the one talking about *pressing charges* for battery. I thus commented something to the effect of ""you can't sue for a crime."" This is because it would be a non sequitur to go into criminal intent when the parent had mentioned suing for battery (if that had been the case).

Time 4: I was promptly corrected and took back my comment within about five minutes. I decided not to delete because I thought the parent commenter should see my edit.

Time 5: People start coming in and posting either without reading or without understanding what happened, or just because of plain old trolling.

If you still don't understand, ask your lawyer daddy or your 1L mentor or your whoever helps wipe your ass at whatever level you claim to be.

My dad died last month, I posted it on Facebook after making sure everyone close knew because I wasn't going to message every person I know and tell them. My cousin posted she miscarried because she was 17 weeks pregnant and a lot of people knew she was pregnant, she didn't want to deal with the ""how's the pregnancy going?"" questions. There are logical reasons to do this. "
"My friend had them and tried to show me.  It had something to do with hitting em or something.  I just remember it was like a stupider and more boring version of playing marbles, and marbles were super boring and stupid."
"And I deduce you're taking a /cringepics comment way too seriously. But it's cool, you're probably super fun in real life."
"I said ""indicate,"" not ""insinuate."" The parent comment (go ahead, go and read it thoroughly, now) was referring to pressing charges for the *crime* of battery on a subway train. And if you pull ""the MPRE"" out of your ass you clearly aren't actually a lawyer or law student and have confirmed that you're just trollin' poorly. If you are considering going to law school, you have the perfect jackass mentality, but your reading comprehension is lacking. I'd advise against it."
"Try commenting there without circlejerking.

With anything not in a litteral sense, but in a figurative way where anything means something with substance. And not something like 'yeah omg creep'. If you say: 'He might be desperate, but he doesn't look like a stalker or anythinf...' You get banned. I did..."
"I think the weird dude isn't racist, he's just an idiot. "
"I grew up during pogs and still have no idea how you ""play"" pogs.  Thought they were just another ""collectible""."
"bwahahaha.  Kid, let me know when you pass the MPRE.   You didn't ""insinuate"" anything.  You explicitly said that you can't sue for a ""crime"" when the person was obviously referring to the tort.  It's okay, you thought you were being technically correct but instead you just looked like a jackass. "
It can be.
"You should probably troll harder. Nowhere did I indicate otherwise. You sue for the tort of battery; you can't retain a lawyer to sue for the crime of battery. And if that is what you think law school is really all about, let me know when you matriculate or pass 1L."
