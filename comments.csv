"To be quite honest, I didn't see the ""here"" in your post the first time. My bad! "
God why just why did I click on that

Why cant they both call if they want to?
"&gt; Whether you're Quasimodo or a Greek God in mortal form; unless you accept that a) the girls/guys you are going for are people, equals, and should be viewed/treated as such b) accept yourself for who you are, have self-respect and healthy self-esteem/confidence; you'll do poorly with the opposite gender. That's it.

Yes, only confident liberal male feminists get laid. Totally."
"Is it really that hard to type ""I really like you and want to know you better. Would you like to go on a date/coffee/movie/dinner?"" And be done with it? "

You're not listening.  It would be weird here.  That's not a normal thing normal people say to each other.  It would get an awkward smile or awkward thanks out of a loooot of people
"lol, keep telling yourself that. "
&gt;He's a special kind of *desperate* 
"Still might have been too soon? If I just broke up with my fianc√© I wouldn't be looking at any other man for a long time, no matter who it was. "
"Oh shit. I really wanted to go to that Tupperware party of yours, but I'm 53, divorced, and with 5 kids. What a shame."
"How is them saying God bless you presumptuous? They're not presuming anything about you.  lol They believe in God, they're not assuming you do or anything. And saying thank you doesn't mean anything other than that you've got a bit of respect in you. "
what if brad pitt asked her out after she just broke up with someone?
I feel a bit bad for the guy being so oblivious but if a girl says she doesn't date then just assume she's telling the truth and not playing hard to get. No good can come from pulling that thread. 
"Brah, he wasn't trynah ""cyber fight"" tho"
With a tad of creepypms mixed in. 
"Did everyone here miss the last picture she posted with a TON of cleavage? Guarantee that was how she was actually dressed, and she changed for the other pictures to show less cleavage "
Lol out of the friendzone and into the douchezone. 
"I got banned without ever having posted or commented there because in one of those AskReddit threads about the worst subs I commented /r/creepyPMs because of the ""no victim-blaming"" bullshit, the Nazi mods and overall shitty community. About an hour later I get a message saying I've been banned for speaking out against them."
It's presumptuous a bit but mainly just no one but super religious people would say that here so it would be really weird is all. 
Not a single car...not one.
I'm just not from a place where people say that.  Only a really overly religious person would say that to someone and it would be awkward. 
My favorite part was where pink implied that two pieces of evidence were equally valid if they both came from Google links.
Am I missing something? I don't get why that was such a good burn. 
The hell is wrong with you people. 
"Is it /r/spacedicks?

Um no ew gross I feel like a wet finger would suffice it's not the asshole knows the difference between a tongue and a wet finger..

"My theory: someone pranked Auntie's phone to auto correct some oft used phrase to ""if he gets diarrhea lick his butt"" and just waited patiently for Auntie to fall prey. Maybe Auntie said, Give him hugs for Auntie. God, I am just going to pretend like I'm right because that is just disturbing. "

"Although I see where you are coming from. I personally am a girl and I've had many PUA's try for my attention. Honestly in my opinion I tend to find them pathetic and sad. If you have to play mind games to get people to like you then you probably aren't worth anything to begin with. Most of us women know what they're doing, if it works it's because we saw something more in them. "
Ape shitting

He is so cringe &gt;\\\\&lt; 
He's like Zapp Brannigan and Kif mixed in one person.  Sheesh.
No your panties wouldn't. He is an arsehole.
"I'm pretty sure these PUA guys really did sleep with a lot of girls. Probably not the kind of girl you and I would be interested in, but as satisfying as it may be to call their ridicule and all that, their stuff does work in some settings."
Well Wednesday has passed OP. Did the creep pretend to be your buddy?

"It is a strange social norm, but it's a norm nonetheless. It clearly doesn't mean what it used to anymore and when people say ""bless you"" most of the time they don't say it with religious intent. It's just a polite thing to say bless you, and while it's not mandatory to thank them for it, it is polite. But, if you don't want to thank them for your own reasons then that's perfectly fine, but to lost people who don't know that you'll just seem rude is all. I can see where you're coming from but just be weary of how others may see you. "
I think so. After that it gets kinda fuzzy
